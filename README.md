# SocketMessanger

Welcome to the SocketMessanger!
<br>
This is a project for a small messanger on Python using sockets.

## Why use sockets?
Beacuse its fun, and why not?

## Progress?
Added a login and a admin list thats functional.
<br>
I still dont recommend running the app tho, its very unstable and its easy to crash the server
<br>
Im currently working on Admin commands like /kick, /mute, etc...
<br>
What I want to add later on:
- Spam protection
- Sending Images
- UI
<br>
This will take time, but when i finish the project it will be perfect

## Used Libraries:
- threading
- sockets
