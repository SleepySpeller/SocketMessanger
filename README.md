# SocketMessanger

Welcome to the SocketMessanger!
<br>
This is a project for a small messanger on Python using sockets.

## Why use sockets?
Beacuse its fun, and why not?

## Progress?
Added a login and a admin list thats functional.
<br>
I still dont recommend running the app tho, its very unstable and its easy to crash the server
<br>
I made a [Project on Github](https://github.com/SleepySpeller/SocketMessanger/projects/1) where I have a to-do list.
<br>
I will make a Twilio to-do list later since its a lot easier to manage, but I will still update the GitHub one
<br>

## Used Libraries:
- threading
- sockets
