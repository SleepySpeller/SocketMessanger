# SocketMessanger

Welcome to the SocketMessanger!
<br>
This is a project for a small messanger on Python using sockets.

## Why use sockets?
Beacuse its fun, and why not?

## Progress?
Made an pre-alpha code, that is not really stable.
<br>
Im currently working on a spam protection.
I currently want to make:
- Commands like kick, ban, mute, etc...
- Option to join custom servers with passwords
- UI
<br>
This will take time, but when i finish the project it will be perfect

## Used Libraries:
- threading
- sockets
